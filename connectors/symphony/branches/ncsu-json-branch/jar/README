This is (currently) a variation on the Sirsi Symphony connector from
Lehigh University.  It contains a Java/Maven project that builds against
version 1.1 of the XC NCIP v2 Toolkit; the source code was
originally derived from the 1.0 version of the Lehigh codebase, but
adds significant modifications.  So, uh, joint copyright?

It also contains Perl source (under src/main/perl) that defines
a Perl module and sample CGI script that are used to implement a 
service that executes Sirsi API calls and serializes the results
as JSON.  

The primary difference between this version and the Leigh version is that
this one uses Apache HTTP Client to handle the communication between
the connector and the Sirsi server, and converts JSON responses into
Toolkit classes that are used to generate responses.
