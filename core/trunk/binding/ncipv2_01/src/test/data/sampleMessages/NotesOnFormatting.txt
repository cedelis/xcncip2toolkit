These files are used as input to a JUnit test class (TestJAXBTranslator) which has an option to use the "diff"
command (like that available in most unixes) to compare the input file to a temporary file containing the marshalled
output from the translation process used by the Toolkit. When used this helps to guarantee that the Toolkit preserves
all of the data from every NCIP message - at least those for which we have examples in this directory.

For this to work the input files must be formatted properly. The exact requirements are as follows.

Note: Except where clearly indicated, none of these are requirements of the NCIP standard (although all of
them are within the bounds of conformance with the standard). These are only the requirements of our automated JUnit
test process.

1) The files should be pretty-printed, i.e. one element per line with indenting. The diff is done with the "-w" switch,
which means whitespace isn't significant, and so it doesn't matter how many spaces you indent each line but it does
matter that each element be on its own line.

2) You must use "ns1" as the namespace alias for the NCIP namespace.

3) The order of attributes is important, where there are more than one. At the time of writing I'm only aware of there
being multiple attributes on the NCIPMessage element; the proper order is version and then the xmlns:ns1 attribute, like
this:
 <ns1:NCIPMessage
   ns1:version="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ncip/v2_0/imp1/xsd/ncip_v2_0.xsd" xmlns:ns1="http://www.niso.org/2008/ncip">

Note that the element and its attributes are on separate lines, which is the format that the JUnit test class will
always produce and so your input files must match.

4) Per the NCIP Implementation Profile 1 (part 2 of the standard), the XML prolog must indicate version 1.0 of XML
 and UTF-8 encoding, like this:
 <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

5) You must use double-quotes in the XML prolog and around the values of attributes.

6) While the NCIP Toolkit will accept a broader range of date/time formats than are permitted by the NCIP Standard
(see Section 5.3 of the NCIP Implementation Profile 1, part 2 of the standard), the output will always be formatted
as follows: CCYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssZ where “CC” represents the century, “YY” the year, “MM” the month, and “DD” the day,
the letter “T” is the date/time separator, and “hh”, “mm” and “ss” represent hour, minute, and second respectively.
The seconds may be followed by a "." decimal separator and three digits, representing milliseconds. Again, note that
this is a *subset* of the format allowed by the NCIP standard. Notably it omits the leading '+' (plus) or '-' (minus)
signs, it does not include portions of a second smaller than a millisecond, and it always includes the trailing 'Z'
indicating the UTC timezone.

These are examples of dateTime elements produced by the Toolkit:
2010-11-20T00:00:00.329Z - includes milliseconds.
2001-12-17T09:30:47Z     - no milliseconds.
2011-02-17T00:00:47.010Z - includes milliseconds (note the trailing zero; if milliseconds are non-zero, then
                           three digits will always be produced.

Here is an example of a dateTime format that is valid per the Implementation Profile 1 but will not be handled
with full precision by the NCIP Toolkit:
2011-02-17T00:00:47.1234567Z - the sub-millisecond portion (4567) of the seconds will be dropped by tne Toolkit; the
                               Toolkit will output "2010-11-20T06:00:00.123Z".

Here is an example of a dateTime format that is valid per the Implementation Profile 1 but will truncated
by the Toolkit:
2010-11-20T06:32:17.91388Z - with sub-millisecond fractions of a second. The Toolkit will truncate the digits
past the millisecond (e.g. treat this as 17.913 seconds); if logging is set to DEBUG level this will be reported
in the log.

Here is an example of a dateTime format that is valid per the Implementation Profile 1 but will not be accepted
by the Toolkit:
+2010-11-20T06:00:00Z - with the '+' (plus sign) prefix. The Toolkit will throw the following exception:
Exception 'org.extensiblecatalog.ncip.v2.service.ServiceException': 'JAXBException unmarshalling from InputStream.' in 'createResponseData' converting the sample file LookupItemResponseSample2.xml:
	javax.xml.bind.UnmarshalException
	cvc-datatype-valid.1.2.1: '+2010-11-20T06:00:00Z' is not a valid value for 'dateTime'.
And similarly for the '-' (minus sign) prefix.

At the moment the Toolkit does not correctly handle dates prior to 1582-10-14, which is the year (but not the month
and day) of the adoption of the Gregorian calendar; as the Toolkit uses Java's GregorianCalendar class for its dateTime
values, there is likely a connection that is not yet fully understood. As an example, "1582-10-14T00:00:00Z" is
accepted as input but when output becomes 1582-10-04T00:00:00Z. It is hoped that this is not significant for modern
circulation applications (i.e., that items won't have been on loan since 1581).

Here is the one known example of a dateTime format that the Toolkit will accept that is NOT valid per the
Implementation Profile 1. Note that this will not match the output format used by the Toolkit and so should be
avoided in these test files:
2010-11-20T00:00:00-06:00 - uses "UTC delta" indicating 6 hours earlier than UTC; the toolkit will output
                            this as 2010-11-20T06:00:00Z
